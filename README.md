# Dietary Intake in Scotlandâ€™s CHildren (DISH)
## Achievement of the Scottish Dietary Goals, Nutrient and Food Group Intake, Food Beyond the School Gate and Consumption of Energy Drinks

This repository processes and analyses data from a national survey of children and young people aged 2 to 15 years living in Scotland. 

The main outcomes were:
1. Achievement of the Scottish Dietary Goals
2. Nutrient intake including adherence to the RNIs and LRNIs
3. Food group intake
4. Consumption of food beyond the school gates
5. Consumption of energy drinks

Data were collected using a survey and 24-hour dietary recalls (herein 'intake24').

# R scripts
## DISH_cleaning

This R script processes the raw survey and intake24 data: 
- Renames variables 
- Removes ineligibles and incompletes
- Categorises 'other' responses
- Creates new variables: age groups (2-4y, 5-10y, 11-15y), recall number, number of recalls, number of items per recall, day of the week recall completed, meal types, main food groups, reporting food groups, device intake24 completed on
- Re-codes missing food codes
- Removes diet supplements and breast milk
- Removes dairy-free items from dairy food groups
- Converts intake24 nutrient variables to numeric and replaces NAs with 0s
- Creates new nutrient variables: food energy, food and milk energy, food weight, food and milk weight, percent of calories, salt


## DISH_intake24

This R script calculates the mean daily intakes of nutrients and mean participant intakes of nutrients. It also cleans or drops energy intakes <400 or >4,000 kcal.


## SDG and RNI/LRNI Adherence Script

This R script creates binary variables for adherence to Scottish Dietary Goals and Adherence to RNI and LRNIs. It also calculates the frequency of vegetables consumed.


## DISH Results: This script creates report tables for Mean daily intakes, SDGs, and RNI/LNRI adherence
