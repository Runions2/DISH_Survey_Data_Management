Data were collected using a survey and up to four 24-hour dietary recalls (herein 'intake24').

# Data Management Files
## DISH_cleaning

This R script processes the raw survey and intake24 data: 
- renames variables 
- removes ineligibles and incompletes
- categorises 'other' responses
- creates new variables
- re-codes missing food codes
- removes diet supplements and breast milk
- removes dairy-free items from dairy food groups
- converts intake24 nutrient variables to numeric and replaces NAs with 0s
- removes or cleans recalls completed in <2 minutes or with <=5 items
- cleans or drops energy intakes <400 kcal or >4,000 kcal

## DISH_intake24

This R script calculates:
- total daily intakes of nutrients
- total daily intakes of food groups
- mean participant intakes of nutrients (across 1-4 recalls)
- mean participant intakes of food groups (across 1-4 recalls)
- runs the Multiple Source Method to estimate usual dietary intakes
- adherence to the Scottish Dietary Goals
- meeting the RNIs
- meeting the LRNIs
- consumers of food categories, food groups, and discretionary and additional food groups

### Output
- intake24_participant.csv : Participant level data
- intake24_recall.csv : Recall (daily) level data
- intake24_item.csv : Item level data
