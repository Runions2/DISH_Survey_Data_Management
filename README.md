# R scripts
## DISH_cleaning

This R script processes the raw survey and intake24 data: 
- Renames variables 
- Removes ineligibles and incompletes
- Categorises 'other' responses
- Creates new variables: age groups (2-4y, 5-10y, 11-15y), recall number, number of recalls, number of items per recall, day of the week recall completed, meal types, main food groups, reporting food groups, device intake24 completed on
- Re-codes missing food codes
- Removes diet supplements and breast milk
- Removes dairy-free items from dairy food groups
- Converts intake24 nutrient variables to numeric and replaces NAs with 0s
- Creates new nutrient variables: food energy, food and milk energy, food weight, food and milk weight, percent of calories, salt


## DISH_intake24

This R script calculates:
- total daily intakes of nutrients
- total daily intakes of food groups
- mean participant intakes of nutrients (across 1-4 recalls)

- meeting the RNIs
- meeting the LRNIs

It also cleans or drops energy intakes <400 kcal or >4,000 kcal.
